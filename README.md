# Analyzer for Minecraft speedrunigt

Notes: 

1. Only saves named by the mod 'atum' can be read.

2. Put the files in your MultiMC/instances directory, and run the 'bat'.

## What does it do?

It collects speedrungigt records of your completed runs, and output to a CSV file under MultiMC/instances.

## Todos

**Currently appreciated if anyone can make a display UI based on the output CSV, presenting all runs clearly.**
